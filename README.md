# Customer_Churn_Prediction_using_ML
This project predicts customer churn using a Telco dataset with machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and balancing data using SMOTE. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
